We, the undersigned, call on our leaders to stop sending taxpayer dollars to Israel until human rights are respected and international law is upheld.  

Every year, billions of U.S. tax dollars are sent abroad instead of supporting our communities at home. We believe this funding must be reconsidered to prioritize peace, diplomacy, and justice.  

By signing this petition, you add your voice to the growing call for accountability. Letâ€™s ensure our leaders act with wisdom and compassion.
